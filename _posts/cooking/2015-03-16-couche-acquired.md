Yesterday I received a proper linen baking couche, as well as a lame. Hopefully having an actual lame will remind me to score the loaves, and I'm taking a gamble and hoping a baking couche will help the shape and crust of the loaves.

Poolish started 8:30PM, oven light was left on for two hours, and then turned off. It is approximately 65F in the kitchen, and the poolish was 77F in the oven when he light was turned off around 10:40. By morning, the poolish had dropped in temperature to about 62F, around room temperature in the kitchen, although I am unsure when in the night this happened. The poolish was quite wet, unlike the somewhat dry appearance of the previous, hot poolish. The development seemed quite good.

Mixing started at 10:00, and the first fold occured at 10:22.
