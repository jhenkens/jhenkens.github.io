Yesterday I received a proper linen baking couche, as well as a lame. Hopefully having an actual lame will remind me to score the loaves, and I'm taking a gamble and hoping a baking couche will help the shape and crust of the loaves.

Poolish started 8:30PM, oven light was left on for two hours, and then turned off. It is approximately 65F in the kitchen, and the poolish was 77F in the oven when he light was turned off around 10:40. By morning, the poolish had dropped in temperature to about 62F, around room temperature in the kitchen, although I am unsure when in the night this happened. The poolish was quite wet, unlike the somewhat dry appearance of the previous, hot poolish. The development seemed quite good.

Mixing started at 10:00, and the first fold occured at 10:22. A few folds were a few minutes late, resulting in proofing starting at about 2:00 sharp (15 or so minutes late).

Baking started 3:07PM, preheated to 505. A medium volume of hot steam was used, scoring performed using the lame. Even with a lame, scoring is something I will need to learn, that's tough! Once bread was loaded and oven was steamed, oven was set to 475 again. Note that the oven runs about 10F cool, so its really 495 and 465. After 16 minutes of baking, the dough temp was about 203 internally. The oven was partially vented and cooled down during this period of measuring the temperature. After the temperature was measured, the bread was baked for another 4 minutes, and was out of the oven just before 3:30PM.

Visibly, the crust was not much different than previous batches. The scoring was visible, but definitely not deep enough. The crumb was a little bit denser than the previous batch, but still quite tasty.

Perhaps for next batch we should introduce another hour in the fold/ferment step, or an additional 30-60 minutes in the proof step.
