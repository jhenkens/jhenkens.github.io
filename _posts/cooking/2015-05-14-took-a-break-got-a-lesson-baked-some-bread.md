title: "Took a break, got a lesson, baked some bread."
---


On the first weekend of May, I went down to Santa Barbara for a family wedding. While I was there, I made sure I left myself extra time to see my friends Jon and Danny, who were kind enough to host me for dinner and a bread baking lesson. Jon has given me help throughout this process, but baking bread hands on with him was a huge help, with minor improvements here and there, and major improvements in my preshaping and shaping.

First off, let me provide a [link to the recipe we baked with](/recipes/baking/bread/jons-baking-lesson-dough/), and I have been using for my past two batches.

The recipe has a number of changes to the technique - the "starfish into a boule" preshaping (as I like to think of it), a new way of shaping the dough, and (my favorite) the switch to rice flour for dusting.

When baking with Jon, we made the bâtards you can see below. One of them is mine (in that I shaped it), I can't remember which one, but they were both gorgeous.

A week and a half later, I finally got around to recreating the experience at home.

And then again three days later.

Pretty dramatic change in terms of the oven spring, how much it opened up, the texture, etc. The crust actually crumbles a bit when cutting, has a bit of crunch to it, allows for the crumb to open up and become less dense.

I'm quite grateful for the advice I was given, and the results show. 

I still need to work on making my bâtards a bit more football shaped, and perhaps work on maybe a slightly shallower and more consistent scoring or a lower temperature to reduce the charring of the ear.

Now I've just got to keep it regular, and hopefully go back and try out some of the other hydration doughs I've attempted before with the newly learned techniques while honing them.
