title: Don't Run and Mix
---

I repeated the oven-open technique for the poolish - it was just over 70F when I woke up atound 9:00 this morning.

However, I started creating the dough immediately after a run, and my low blood sugar definitely affected my cognitive ability to mix a dough. I forgot to add the salt till I was midway through removing the dough from the mixer - so I put it back in and mixed it for another minute. Also, I am completely unsure if I used 275g of water or 250g of water in the mixing bowl this morning. The reason that I think I may have used 250g (25g less than my friend's recipe calls for), is that the dough was relatively dry when working with it. It hardly stuck to the butchers board, when usually I have to flour it relatively well, and used the bowl scraper a bit to remove the dough from the board at times (particularly underneath wherever I had hit to degas the dough).

Additionally, today was the first day using the baguette boards to transfer the proofed b√¢tards to the parchment paper. And I also scored slightly better today.

That said, the rest of the baking process I followed my friend's recipe for the modified Bouchon Bakery master dough.

The resulting bread is my prettiest yet externally - a small segment actually sprung open through the scoring. But from the one slice I've tried so far, the texture is very, very chewy in the crumb, and kinda off in flavor. Upsetting, but acceptable given I knowingly messed up today.
