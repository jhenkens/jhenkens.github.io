title: Less Mixing
---

On Wednesday evening, I had a nice skype session with a friend of mine discussiong a few of my failings so far with baking, and received some wonderful pointers and advice, as well as a few recipes, one of which is just a very slight modification of the Bouchon Master Dough recipe that I have been following.

I attempted this loaf using his modified Bouchon Master Dough recipe, which calls for slightly less hydration in the final dough, a shorter mixing time, and no fold immediately after mixing, reducing the number of folds to 2 over 3 hours.

For the folding, dividing and shaping steps, the resulting dough felt very, very similar to the master dough. The lack of the first fold saved me from struggling with the dough at its stickiest, which I greatly enjoyed.

I also recieved pointers on how to score my bâtards better, which absolutely made scoring infinitely easier. However, like a fool, I scored before transfering to the parchment paper I intended to bake on, which resulted in the scores being closed while I transfered the bread. Additionally, I was, through this day, transferring the dough by hand - two baguette transfer boards have been ordered and should help with transfering the shaped and proofed bâtards from the couche to the parchment paper.

As with my previous experiences, with my oven tempearture at 460, my loaves are done much earlier than I expect as per most recipes. The Bouchon recipe calls for 25-30 minutes, and my friend's recipe calls for 30, yet my crumb reaches 210F within about 20-22 minutes.
