title: Double Steam All the Way
---

Baking has been slowing down, as other stuff has been picking up, but I'm going to keep finding time.

I started a poolish yesterday at around 10:45PM, and started the dough roughly 12 hours later. While handling the dough for the folding and preshaping, it seemed a bit stickier, perhaps slightly less developed gluten. But it is hard to tell exactly. I was following [Jon's Modified Bouchon Master Dough](/recipes/baking/bread/jon-bouchon-master-dough) recipe for the most part. I bake at a lower temperature (440F) so that I can hit 30 minutes in my oven (460F results in 24 minute bake). Additionally, I do a slightly different shaping. 

I form a vertically-long rectangle, degas, fold the top third down, close seam with fingertips, fold the top corners into the center, closing the seams with fingertips, then folding the bottom third up, flipping the seam towards me, and closing the final seam with the heel of the palm, as discussed in the recipe.

I think I need to try doing the shaping twice - spare the closing of the final seam, as I think that was how I got my one loaf in the past to open up.

On this bake, I also steamed the dough twice, just as an experiment, using cold tap water (perhaps about 60F), once at insertion, once at 4:00 into the bake. The second steam was not nearly as explosive, due to the rocks and chain being much colder, and actually remained steaming through the remaining 26 minutes of the bake.

Neither loaf really seemed to open up.
