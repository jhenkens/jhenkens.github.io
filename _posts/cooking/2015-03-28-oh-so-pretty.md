title: Oh So Pretty!

I took a few days of break from baking, and decided that, while unemployed, I'd start trying to bake as early in the day as I can muster. Today, that meant starting weighing the ingredients at about 8:00 am.

I used the open-oven poolish techique again, which seemed to work well. The poolish was doing its thing for nearly 15 hours on the dot when I started the dough.

For mixing, I added all of the ingredients except the yeast, mixed for 1 minute on speed 1, stopped the mixer, and hand mixed using a bowl scraper until the ingredients were relatively well integrated (my Kitchenaid mixer + J shaped dough hook doesn't do very well on incorporating the mixture at the start, it seems to just swirl around the poolish and water in a dry bowl of flower). After that, I mixed four about 2.5 minute on speed 1, poured the yeast in, and mixed for 3 minutes on speed 2.

I then transfered it to a bowl to rest for an hour before the first of two folds.

Per my friend's advice, I lowered my baking temperature from (according to my best guess/thermostats) 460F to 440F. This increased the bake time from about 22 minutes to about 26 minutes for the doughs interior to reach 210F (I'm getting pretty good about guessing when that is - last three batches I've been able to open the oven, stab the loaf, and have it read 210F exactly on the first try).

Additionally, I decreased proofing time by about 10 minutes before I started transfering them to the parchment paper. I still need some work on shaping, transferring, and scoring, but things are getting better!

One of the two loaves opened up beautifully, nearly the entire way down, and had a great football shape. Crumb seems maybe slightly dense, but taste is good.

I'm so excited about this one loaf that I've already (as of 6:15PM on 3/28/2015) started a poolish for two more loaves tomorrow morning.
