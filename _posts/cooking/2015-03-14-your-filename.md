Poolish was started at 11:15PM on Friday the 13th of March.

The oven light did not burn out over night. Looks like we got a faulty bulb that caused the short lived life previously. That said, oven reached a temperature of about 92F overnight with the light on, warmer than we want for a poolish. Perhaps on an early start poolish we could leave the light on till midnight and then turn it off with the oven closed for the night. The poolish looked fine, however. Good, but seemingly completed, development. 

Mixing of the dough started 11:06.

During shaping, additional folds were performed to attempt to increase surface tension on dough. Besides that, all other dough creation steps were performed very similarly, with the difference that today is quiet warm, perhaps 80F in the kitchen versus the normal low 70s. Despite the attempt at increased surface tension, the dough spread a similar amount during proofing.

I used a medium amount of steam during the baking process. The oven was preheated to 500F, set to 475 after insertion. Took 3 minutes to return to heat. Baked for 15 minutes closed, slight venting and two more minutes of baking.

Nice looking crumb, no crust again. Taste is decent, I just really want a damn crust!
