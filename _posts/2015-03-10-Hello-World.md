Hi reader,

My name is Johan Henkens. I'm a pretty terrible cook, and an even worse baker. I'm going to be sharing my experiences in becoming a better baker, and hopefully a better cook. Additionally, I'll be logging some recepies that I enjoy making. This is mostly for my own benefit, to keep track of stuff as time goes on.
