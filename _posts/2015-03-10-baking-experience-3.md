Poolish was started Mar08 at 6:30PM. Poolish was constructed with more yeast than supposed to, by accident. Likely 0.4 grams rather than 0.1.
Bread was started at 9:45AM, over 15 hours after the poolish was started. The poolish still looked very active due to the high yeast levels, it was still bubbling. Poolish was left on counter over night.
At most steps during folding/bench shaping/proofing, bread volume was larger than previous loaves. When baking, bread had significant oven spring.
Bread was steam injected with full gun of water. Oven thermometers reported oven at 450F when set to 460F. I baked 2 loaves for about 14 minutes until crust seemed to be at a correct color, then vented oven and continue baking at a lower temperature (340F) for another few minutes. Resulting bread had nice crumb appearance, but undercooked texture and flavor, and crust, although nicely colored, was very soft and underdeveloped.

Changes for next time:
Test oven heat thoroughly with oven thermometers.
Make sure oven if at 460F or higher INTERNALLY when baking is starting.
Keep poolish in closed oven with light on for 12 hours rather than counter - our kitchen gets chilly at night.
