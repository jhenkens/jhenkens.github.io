Tried to bake using the Bouchon Bakery: Master Dough recepie, to make a batard.

Ingredients used:
King Arthur All Purpose Flour
Red Star Quick Rise (Instant?) Yeast
Menlo Park Tap water @ 75F, I did not let water sit to have chlorine evaporate.
Instead of PAM, a metal bowl was wiped with avocado oil to hold dough between foldings.

Notes:
Scale used wasn't the most accurage. Used Press'n'Seal on poolish covering

Poolish was started at 1AM on Mar05.
Dough was started around 3:30PM. Poolish did not look particularly active - there were few bubbles, no 'cracking lines', as explained in Bouchon Bakery.
First fold was performed at 4:05, second at 5:05, third at 6:05. First fold, dough was extremely sticky, sticking to hands, bowls, etc. Second and third fold were much more manageable.
Dividing was inexact, as scale is unfriendly to dividing. During shaping, dough did not hold much shape. It did seem to proof a bit.
Transfering dough from floured kitchen towel to peel was somewhat difficult, but did not stick.
Transfering dough from peel to pizza stone was VERY difficult - one loaf was lost. I had to use a metal spatula to push it off of the peel, and forgot to score the loaf. Additionally, the loaf did not maintain its original shape - part of it had to be folded back over itself again.
Loaf went into the oven at 8:31PM. Spraying seemed to work alright, perhaps a full gun is a bit too much water, some leaked out of the oven. Most of the steam was done venting within 15 seconds.
Loaf was out of the oven at 9:00PM. Oven light was out so it was difficult to see color. Loaf exterior is too dark.

Taste at 30min out: Flavor is decent, crumb is too dense for most of the loaf, but has some decent development in a few places.
Crust is not chewy, but not particularly crunchy either. Perhaps too much steam was used.

Ideas: We need the poolish to do more. Perhaps use very slightly less water during dough formation. Perhaps use a cornmeal or oil on the transfer peel. Replace lightbulb in oven to be able to inspect better.
