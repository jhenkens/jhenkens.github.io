So this is the first entry I have actually written directly for the Jekyll site. All of the other posts were VERY quickly added to the site with very little formatting.

The poolish was started at 8:30PM sharp the night before. I used ~1.5 grams of yeast in the poolish (maybe 1.0g, hard to tell, because the scale isn't accurate at such small quantities). Poolish was lightly covered in saran wrap, and was placed in oven with light on to ferment overnight. I wish I had left an oven timer on so I could go check the temperature right now (12:20am).

By morning, the lower oven light had burned out again (frustrating!). We swapped the top lightbulb, which has been good for months (at the least) to the lower oven, to see if the lower oven is just a light bulb destroyer. The poolish seemed to have some pretty good development though - and I know the light bulb worked for at least 3 of the 12 hours, and the oven insulation probably helped as well. Mixing was started at 9:40AM.
