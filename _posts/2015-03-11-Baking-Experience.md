So this is the first entry I have actually written directly for the Jekyll site. All of the other posts were VERY quickly added to the site with very little formatting.

The poolish was started at 8:30PM sharp the night before. I used ~1.5 grams of yeast in the poolish (maybe 1.0g, hard to tell, because the scale isn't accurate at such small quantities). Poolish was lightly covered in saran wrap, and was placed in oven with light on to ferment overnight. I wish I had left an oven timer on so I could go check the temperature right now (12:20am).
