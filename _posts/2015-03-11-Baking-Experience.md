So this is the first entry I have actually written directly for the Jekyll site. All of the other posts were VERY quickly added to the site with very little formatting.

The poolish was started at 8:30PM sharp the night before. I used ~1.5 grams of yeast in the poolish (maybe 1.0g, hard to tell, because the scale isn't accurate at such small quantities). Poolish was lightly covered in saran wrap, and was placed in oven with light on to ferment overnight. I wish I had left an oven timer on so I could go check the temperature right now (12:20am).

By morning, the lower oven light had burned out again (frustrating!). We swapped the top lightbulb, which has been good for months (at the least) to the lower oven, to see if the lower oven is just a light bulb destroyer. The poolish seemed to have some pretty good development though - and I know the light bulb worked for at least 3 of the 12 hours, and the oven insulation probably helped as well. Mixing was started at 9:40AM.

First fold occured at 10, second at 11, third fold was performed by Kathryn at 12. Dividing and preshaping was performed by Kathryn at 1:05, and shaping and proofing was performed at 1:25 or so.  
The shaping and proofing occured at a slight delay. The two loaves were of slightly uneven size, that seemed to become more dramatic during shaping and proofing.

Oven was set at 485 when the loaves were ready to go in. Loaves were loaded on parchment paper, and poorly scored using a ceramic knife. The ceramic knife did not really work to score, need to find some other tool.

Steam injection was performed using the water gun at ~75% capacity, using hot tap water. Oven opening was minimal, with ~10 second closing between bread and steam injection. Oven was returned to 480 after steam injection, and could maybe have benefited from an even higher starting temperature.  
Note that per the oven thermometers, the oven runs 10F cool, so 460 was actually 450, 480 should be around 470.

Bread was baked with the oven closed for 15 minutes. After that period, oven was cooled to approximately 400F, and the bread continued to cook for 4 minutes. Initial observation during baking was a few large bubbles on the surface during the steaming process, and a more fragrant crusty smell during baking.

Fresh out of the oven, it appeared that they had a much better developed crust. They were relatively light, and baked very well on the parchment paper.

After cooling for 35 minutes, the first cut was performed. This is officially the first loaf I am decently proud of. The crust still isn't quite there, but at least it has SOME crunch to it! The crumb is relatively well developed, and the taste is quite good.
