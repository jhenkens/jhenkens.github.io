A vexing problem: loaves pitted with air holes so big, there's hardly any bread. Solution: milk contains a protein fragment called glutathione that slightly weakens gluten, the network of proteins that give bread its structure and chew. When the bonds in gluten weaken, more steam is able to escape from the dough, leading to smaller bubbles.
