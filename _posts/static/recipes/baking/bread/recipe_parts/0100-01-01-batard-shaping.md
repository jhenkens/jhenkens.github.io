Clean the work surface of nearly all of the rice flour - keep the flour in a small pile to the side. Working with one piece of dough at a time, lightly dust the top of the boule shaped dough ball with rice flour. Pick up the dough, and place in the small pile, seam side up. 

Transfer the dough to the cleaned work surface, seam side up. Very lightly pat the pat to remove any huge air bubbles, and to shape the dough slightly rectangularly, long side vertically. Position your hands with your fingertips touching at the top of the dough. Using the sides of your hands, lift up the top of the dough. Using the sides of your hands, lift up the top of the dough and fold it over two-thirds of the dough, then fold the top over and bring it down so it covers two-thirds of the dough. Grab the left and right "ears" at the top, and fold them just to the center of the dough, sealing with a light press.

Return the dough to the rice flour pile, and then back to the board and repeat with the other end.

Dust and use the heel of one hand to form an indentation in the dough, along the seam created from the folds. Fold the dough along the edges so that the top and bottom edges meet. Using flat thumbs, "roll" the top and bottom halves into the center, creating a tension on the back of the dough (where the indentation met the board). This indentation is where the scoring will take place. After a couple rolls on both the top and bottom, use the heel of your hand to seal the seam. This motion is a soft but firm pressing to seal the two halves, not a slam.

Turn the dough seam side down. With your hands one on top of the other on the center of the dough, rock the dough back and forth, applying gentle pressure while slowly moving your hands apart, until you reach the ends; keep the diameter consistent. Once your hands are no longer touching each other, the heels of your hands and your fingertips should be resting on the board. As you roll the dough, it will increase in length and the structure will tighten. It's best to keep an eye on the center diameter, as this will dictate the length. 

The finished diameter should be 2-3/4 inches. Lay the loaf on a generously floured baker's couche. Fold or bunch the linen to create small walls on both sides of the loaf to help maintain the shape as the dough proofs.
