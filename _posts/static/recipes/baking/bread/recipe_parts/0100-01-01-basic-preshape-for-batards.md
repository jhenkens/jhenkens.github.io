Flour the baker's couche. Use the bowl scraper to release the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work-surface. Gently pat the dough into a rectangular shape, removing any large bubbles and adding flour only as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the work-surface. Divide the dough into two equal portions. With a light pinch, bring the sides of the dough into the center, rotating 60-90 degrees, and repeating in a circle, sealing the seams lightly. Flip dough, and using the pinky side of the hand against the board, shape the dough into balls, spinning the dough on the work surface.
