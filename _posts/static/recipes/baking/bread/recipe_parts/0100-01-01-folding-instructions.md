Lightly dust the work-surface with flour. Using a bowl scraper, release the dough and turn it onto the work-surface. The dough will be very sticky. Gently pat it into a rectangular shape, removing any large air bubbles and adding flour only as needed to keep the dough form sticking to the work-surface. Do not dust the top of the dough; it should stick to your fingers.

Stretch the left side of the dough upward and outward and fold it over two-thirds of the dough, then stretch and fold the dough from the right side to the opposite side, as if you were folding a letter. Repeat the process, working from the bottom and then the top. 

Turn the dough over, lift it up with the bench scraper, and place seam-side down in the prepared bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and set aside.
