### Directions
#### For the poolish
Combine flour and yeast in a 9-inch porcelain bowl and mix with a butter-knife. Pour in the water and continue to mix until thoroughly combined; the mixture should have the consistency of pancake batter. Cover the bowl lightly with plastic wrap and let sit at 70 degrees F for 12 to 15 hours. 

#### Mixing
Add all the ingredients except the salt to the mixing bowl. Mix on first speed for 3 minute in order to incorporate the ingredients, using a rubber spatula if needed to aid the mixer. Stop the mixer again and sprinkle the yeast over the dough and finish mixing on second speed for 20 minutes. The dough should be supple and moderately loose. Desired dough temperature: 76 degrees F. 


#### Bulk fermentation
The dough is now in the 3-hour bulk fermentation stage. Set a timer for 3, 2, and 1 hour(s), respectively. Spray a 5-quart stainless-steel bowl with canola oil spray, and transfer the dough to the bowl


#### Folding
Fold the dough three times, at 1-hour intervals, starting immediately after mixing. (Note: this is what the bouchon book calls for, but is difficult to perform).

#### Divide and shape

#### Bench rest
Let the doughs rest on the work surface for 15 minutes, covered with a mixing bowl to prevent a skin from forming.

Meanwhile, set up your 13-by-22-inch baking stone and steam-generating kit and preheat the oven to 460 degrees F (standard).

#### Shape the bâtards

#### Proofing

Let proof in a baking couche, covered by a plastic or cardboard box, for 1 hour or until when the dough is delicately pressed with a finger, the impression remains.

#### Baking

Transfer the dough to the baking stone, parchment and all. Immediately spray water (about 2 cups) from the SuperSoaker onto the steam generator (rocks and chain). Quickly shut the door and bake for 25-30 minutes at 460 degrees F (standard), until the crumb reaches a temperature of at least 210F, and crust is to desired color. Rotate the loaves after 16 minutes for more consistent baking. Let cool completely on a cooling rack for at least an hour before slicing.
