* BENCH REST: 15 minutes
* PROOFING: 1 hour
* BAKING TIME: 25-30 minutes


### Directions
#### For the poolish
Combine flour and yeast in a 9-inch porcelain bowl and mix with a butter-knife. Pour in the water and continue to mix until thoroughly combined; the mixture should have the consistency of pancake batter. Cover the bowl lightly with plastic wrap and let sit at 70 degrees F for 12 to 15 hours. 

#### Mixing
Add all the ingredients except the salt to the mixing bowl. Mix on first speed for 1-3 minutes in order to incorporate the ingredients. Stop the mixer, and use a dough scraper to ensure all the dry ingredients are incorporated into the mix. Sprinkle the salt over the dough and finish mixing on second speed for 20 minutes. The dough should be supple and moderately loose. Desired dough temperature: 76 degrees F. 

#### Bulk fermentation
The dough is now in the 3-hour bulk fermentation stage. Set a timer for 3, 2, and 1 hour(s), respectively. Spray a 5-quart stainless-steel bowl with canola oil spray.

#### Folding
Fold the dough three times, at 1-hour intervals, starting immediatley after mixing. Lightly dust the work-surface with flour. Using a bowl scraper, release the dough and turn it onto the work-surface. The dough will be very sticky. Gently pat it into a rectangular shape, removing any large air bubbles and adding flour only as needed to keep the dough form sticking to the work-surface. Do not dust the top of the dough; it should stick to your fingers.

Stretch the left side of the dough upward and outward and fold it over two-thirds of the dough, then stretch and fold the dough from the right side to the opposite side, as if you were folding a letter. Repeat the process, working from the bottom and then the top. 

Turn the dough over, lift it up with the bench scraper, and place seam-side down in the prepared bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and set aside. 

Repeat the process after an hour, and again an hour after that, for a total of three folds.

#### Divide and shape
Flour the baker's couche. Use the bowl scraper to release the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work-surface. Gently pat the dough into a rectangular shape, removing any large bubbles and adding flour only as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the work-surface. Divide the dough into two equal 500 gram portions. Shape each piece into a rectangle with rounded corners. 

#### Bench rest
Let the doughs rest on the work surface for 15 minutes, covered with a mixing bowl to prevent a skin from forming.

Meanwhile, set up your 13-by-22-inch baking stone and steam-generating kit and preheat the oven to 460 degrees F (standard).

#### Shape the bâtards
Working with one piece of dough at a time, turn the dough seam side up and pat to remove any air bubbles. Position your hands with your fingertips touching at the bottom of the dough. Using the sides of your hands, lift up the bottom of the dough. Using the sides of your hands, lift up the bottom of the dough and fold it over two-thirds of the dough, then fold the top over and bring it down so it covers two-thirds of the dough.   

Use the heel of one hand to form an indentation in the dough, fold the dough so that the top and bottom edges meet and use the heel of your hand to seal the seam. turn the dough seam side down. With your hands one on top of the other on the center of the dough, rock the dough back and forth, applying gentle pressure while slowly moving your hands apart, until you reach the ends; keep the diameter consistent. Once your hands are no longer touching each other, the heels of your hands and your fingertips should be resting on the board. As you roll the dough, it will increase in length and the structure will tighten. It's best to keep an eye on the center diameter, as this will dictate the length. 

The finished diameter should be 2-3/4 inches. In a plastic proofing box, lay the loaf on a generously floured baker's couche. Fold or bunch the linen to create small walls on both sides of the loaf to help maintain the shape as the dough proofs.

#### Proofing

Cover in a 18-by-16-by-3-inch polypropylene dough-proofing-box and let proof for 1 hour, or until when the dough is delicately pressed with a finger, the impression remains.

Using the linen, move the dough, one piece at a time to each transfer peel, seam side up, and then to the oven peel lined with parchment paper, seam side down. To achieve bread ears, your blade must be held at about 30 degrees to the surface of the dough and slashed with a shallow cut, about 1/4 inch deep - without hesitation. If the slash is too deep, the flap may collapse from its own weight. If you hesitate, you risk dragging and tearing the skin of the dough.

Further, to increase your chances of forming ears, it’s advised to use a curved razor (also known as a baker's lame), preferably with a handle. Slash the dough with the corner of the razor, not the length of the blade. And use swift motions with your arm to score, not your wrist. Score the bâtard by making 1 diagonal cut straight-down the center; be precise, if the score is slightly off-center the loaf will not bloom beautifully. 

#### Baking

Transfer the dough to the baking stone, parchment and all. Immediately spray water (about 2 cups) from the SuperSoaker onto the steam generator (rocks and chain). Quickly shut the door and bake for 30 minutes at 460 degrees F (standard). Rotate the bread 16 minutes into baking time. Let cool completely on a cooling rack for at least an hour before slicing.
