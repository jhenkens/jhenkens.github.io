DIRECTIONS
=============
POOLISH: Disperse the yeast in the water, add the flour, and mix until smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand for 12 to 16 hours at about 70 degrees F.

MIXING: Add all the ingredients to the mixing bowl, except the salt. Mix on first speed for 3 minutes in order to incorporate the ingredients. If necessary, correct the hydration by adding water or flour in small amounts. Sprinkle the salt over the dough and finish mixing on second speed for 3 to 3-1/2 minutes. The dough should be supple and moderately loose. Desired dough temperature: 76 degrees F.

BULK FERMENTATION: 2 hours.

FOLDING: Fold the dough once after 1 hour.

DIVIDING AND SHAPING: Divide the dough into two equal portions. Preshape lightly into rounds and leave on a lightly floured work surface, seams up, covered with plastic. Once the dough has relaxed sufficiently (10 to 30 minutes, depending on how tightly it was pre-shaped), shape into long, slender, and graceful baguettes. Place them between folds of baker’s linen, leaving enough space between each baguette so they can expand without tearing during final fermentation. Cover the loaves with baker’s linen and plastic to protect them from air currents and prevent the formation of a crust on the surface of the loaves.

PROOFING: 1 to 1-1/2 hour(s) at 76 degrees F.

BAKING: With normal steam, 460 degrees F for 24 to 26 minutes for baguettes, depending on dough weight. Rotate the bread 16 minutes into baking time.
