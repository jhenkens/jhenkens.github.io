* BENCH REST: 30 minutes
* PROOFING: 1 to 1.5 hours
* BAKING TIME: 24 to 26 minutes minutes

Total time including measuring ingredients to removal from oven:
4.5 hours


### Directions
#### For the poolish
Combine flour and yeast in a 9-inch porcelain bowl and mix with a butter-knife. Pour in the water and continue to mix until thoroughly combined; the mixture should have the consistency of pancake batter. Cover the bowl lightly with plastic wrap and let sit at 70 degrees F for 12 to 15 hours. 

#### Mixing
Add all the ingredients except the salt to the mixing bowl. Mix on first speed for 3 minute in order to incorporate the ingredients, using a rubber spatula if needed to aid the mixer. Stop the mixer again and sprinkle the yeast over the dough and finish mixing on second speed for 3 minutes. The dough should be supple and moderately loose. Desired dough temperature: 76 degrees F. 

#### Bulk fermentation
The dough is now in the 2-hour bulk fermentation stage. Set a timer for 2, and 1 hour(s), respectively. Spray a 5-quart stainless-steel bowl with canola oil spray, and transfer the dough to the bowl

#### Folding
Fold the dough once, 1 hour after mixing.

#### Divide and shape

#### Bench rest
Let the doughs rest on the work surface for 30 minutes, covered with a mixing bowl to prevent a skin from forming.

Meanwhile, set up your 13-by-22-inch baking stone and steam-generating kit and preheat the oven to 460 degrees F (standard).

#### Shape the bâtards

#### Proofing

Let proof seam side up in a baking couche, covered by a plastic or cardboard box, for 1 hour or until when the dough is delicately pressed with a finger, the impression remains.

#### Baking

Transfer the dough to the baking stone, parchment and all. Immediately spray water (about 2 cups) from the SuperSoaker onto the steam generator (rocks and chain). Quickly shut the door and bake for 24-26 minutes at 460 degrees F (standard), until the crumb reaches a temperature of at least 210F, and crust is to desired color. Rotate the loaves after 16 minutes for more consistent baking. Let cool completely on a cooling rack for at least an hour before slicing.
