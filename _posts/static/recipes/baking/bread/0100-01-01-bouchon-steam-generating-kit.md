#### Steam generating kit: 
Place 9 pounds golf-ball-sized river rocks (do not use sedimentary rocks which can break apart or even explode with the rapid change of temperature) and the chain (10 feet metal change) in your 13-by-21-by-2-inch hotel-pan on the bottom rack of your oven. Do not place the pan directly on the heating element. Positing the oven rack above the hotel-pan, making sure there's enough room that you'll be able to hit the rocks and chain with the water, and put the baking stone on this rack. Remove all other racks. Preheat the oven for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before baking. We generally turn on the oven at the end of bulk-fermentation.
