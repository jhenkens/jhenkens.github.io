This was cooked for me by a good friend. I have not yet cooked this, but I intend to.

INGREDIENTS

PUNJABI-STYLE SPLIT PIGEON PEAS WITH FLAKY TRIANGULAR FLATBREAD (PARANTHA)
1-1/2 cups split pigeon peas (toor dal), sorted and washed in 3 to 4 changes of water
4-1/2 cups water
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon grated red turmeric
1 tablespoon ground roasted coriander seeds
1 teaspoon ground roasted cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground paprika
1 tablespoon lime juice

FOR THE TARKA
1/3 cup melted ghee
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, left whole
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 (1/2 pound) yellow onion, 1/4-inch dice
2 tablespoons minced fresh curry leaves (optional)
3 long green chiles such as serrano, minced with seeds

FOR THE PARANTHA (Makes 8 flat-breads)
100 grams stone-ground durum whole wheat flour (Chapati also known as Atta flour)
200 grams all-purpose flour
5 grams fine sea salt
30 grams vegetable shortening
180 grams water, ideally at 100 degrees F
1/2 cup melted ghee for basting and rolling

DIRECTIONS
=============
Place the dal in a 4-quart Windsor pan (November) and add the water, salt, turmeric, coriander, cumin, paprika and lime juice. Bring to a boil over a high flame. Reduce the heat to low, and cook, until the dal is creamy, about 30 minutes. There is no need to stir. 

Preheat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet (King) over a high flame for 5 minutes. Add the ghee and swirl it around, once the ghee is smoking, quickly add the cumin seeds; they should sizzle violently upon contact with the hot ghee, add the onion, curry leaves, if using, green chiles and ginger, stirring, until golden, about 2 to 5 minutes. Then transfer to the dal and swirl lightly to mix, with parts of it visible as a garnish.

FOR THE PARANTHA: Place the flours in a 6-quart non-reactive mixing bowl, add the salt, shortening and water, and mix with your clean fingers in round circular motions, until it starts to gather. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons more flour if the dough seems sticky, or some water if it seems too firm. Knead for about 15 minutes, pressing your knuckles lightly into the dough, spreading the dough outward, then gathering the ends together toward the center with your fingers. Push down the center, then repeat pressing and gathering a few times until you have a soft and pliable dough that does not stick to the fingers. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest at least 1 and up to 4 hours at room temperature. (This allows the wheat gluten to develop.) If keeping for a longer period, refrigerate the dough.

Preheat a 14-inch tava (Pudding) over a medium flame until a sprinkling of the flour immediately turns dark brown. Wipe off the flour and proceed. While the tava is heating, with lightly oiled hands (preferably ghee) divide the dough into 8  round balls; cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying.

Working with each portion separately, flatten into a disc with your fingertips, generously coat with flour, and roll into a 5-to-6-inch circle. Brush the top surface lightly with ghee and fold in half, forming a semi-circle.

Brush the top of the semi-circle with ghee and fold in half once again, forming a triangle. Flatten this triangle into a larger triangle with your fingertips, coat it with flour once again, and roll it into a 6- to 7-inch triangle, taking care to maintain its shape.

Place the parantha on the hot tava. Turn over when it is slightly cooked and dotted with tiny golden spots on the bottom, about 40 to 50 seconds. When the other side is covered with larger brown dots, turn it over, and brush lightly with ghee. Flip it over again and fry the oiled side about 40 seconds. Similarly, baste and fry the other side another 40 seconds. There should be a total of 4 turns.

Remove from the tava and serve.
