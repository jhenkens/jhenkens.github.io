---
I've made this dish a few times, and I'm beginning to like it quite well.

- 1-2 teaspoon Garam Masala
- 1 teaspoon Tumeric
- 1 teaspoon ground Coriander
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 onion
- 2 tomatoes or 14oz crushed tomato can (you want some chunks still)
- 2 can chickpeas
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1-1.25" thick piece of ginger

If you would like to add some heat to the masala, add another teaspoon of chilipowder.

**For the rice:**
- Basmati rice (2 cups uncooked is usually good for above ingredients)
- 1/2 Tsp. Tumeric
- 1/4 Tsp. Coriander

You can add a half teaspoon of tumeric, and a quarter teaspoon of some coriander to the rice if you choose, but otherwise follow rice directions

###Mis en place
- Dice the onion, and tomatoes if not canned. 
- Mince garlic
- Grind ginger on ginger plate. 
- Rinse and strain chickpeas, submerge in water and remove any excess shells. 
- Prepare spices + salt in one dish. 

###Process Onions/Tomatoes
- Add onion + tomatoes to a food processor/blender and make into a salsa-like consistency.

###Begin cooking
- Heat two tablespoons EVOO in a dutch oven/large stock pot. 
- In medium-medium high heat, pour in tomatoes/onion mixture and cook for around 8 minutes. Keep at a very low boil, almost a simmer. 
- Add spices and garlic and ginger, and mix for two minutes. 
- Add chickpeas. 
- Once mixture returns to a slight boil, cover and reduce to a low simmer.
- Simmer for at least 60 minutes, as long as a few hours. 

Mixture should not be soupy, but instead a thick almost pasty mixture.
Quite a bit thicker than a tomato sauce. If mixture is too thick, simply remove lid and simmer/low heat until mixture thickens before serving.
