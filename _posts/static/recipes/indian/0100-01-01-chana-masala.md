I've made this dish a few times, and I'm beginning to like it quite well.

### Ingredients
- 2 teaspoons Garam Masala
- 1 teaspoon Tumeric
- 1 teaspoon ground Coriander
- 0.75" of a small serano pepper (2 inch long, sharpie thickness)
- 1.5 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 onion
- 2 tomatoes or 14oz crushed tomato can (you want some chunks still)
- 2 can chickpeas
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1-1.25" thick piece of ginger
- 0.5 cup water

#### Notes
This should make a mild-medium spiced dish, depending on the pepper. This dish actually calls for indian green chilis, which are harder to find. I haven't made it with a green chili - I am unsure as to its strength relative to a serano.
If you want to have a mild dish, seed the serano before using it. If you want more heat, use up to double the pepper (for 'normal' heat lovers, not those born in the heat, raised by it.)

#### For the rice:
You can add a half teaspoon of tumeric, and a quarter teaspoon of some coriander to the rice if you choose to have a basic indian rice, but otherwise follow rice directions
This dish is also wonderful with [Bobby Flay's Basmati Rice](indian/bobby-flay-basmati-rice/).
- Basmati rice (2 cups uncooked is usually good for above ingredients)
- 1/2 Tsp. Tumeric
- 1/4 Tsp. Coriander


###Mis en place
- Dice the onion, and tomatoes if not canned. 
- Mince garlic
- Mince the serano pepper, with seeds.
- Grind ginger on ginger plate. 
- Rinse and strain chickpeas, submerge in water and remove any excess shells. 
- Prepare spices + salt in one dish. 

###Process Onions/Tomatoes
- Add onion + tomatoes to a food processor/blender and make into a salsa-like consistency.

###Begin cooking
- Heat two tablespoons EVOO in a dutch oven/large stock pot. 
- In medium-medium high heat, pour in tomatoes/onion mixture and cook for around 8 minutes. Keep at a very low boil, almost a simmer. 
- Add spices, chilis, garlic and ginger, and mix for two minutes. 
- Add chickpeas. 
- Add half cup of water
- Once mixture returns to a slight boil, cover and reduce to a low simmer.
- Simmer for at least 60 minutes, as long as a few hours. 

Mixture should not be soupy, but instead a thick almost pasty mixture.
Quite a bit thicker than a tomato sauce. If mixture is too thick, simply remove lid and simmer/low heat until mixture thickens before serving. The mixture can be smooshed a bit with the back of a spatula before serving - just a bit, we aren't trying to mash it, just break down a small percentage of the chickpeas.
