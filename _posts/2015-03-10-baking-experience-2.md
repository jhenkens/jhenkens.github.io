Poolish started at 8:20PM Mar05.txt. A larger pinch of yeast was used than Mar05.
Used Glad press'n'seal, but ensured that there is now space for air exchange.

Bread was started at 8:45AM Mar06. Polish seemed to have more activity.
Had a bit of crusting on the top, some small patches of lines.

Initial 3 minute mixing of dough incorporated much more flour than first batch.
10 minutes into mixing, dough is much more consistent than previous batch.

Mixing was started at 8:54am.

First fold was still very sticky - folds after that were quite easy.
After preshaping, one half of loaf seemed to be much stickier than the other.
One half as very easy to shape, one stuck to the board and hands more.
The stickier loaf seemed to relax much more doing proofing than the other loaf did.

Forgot to score, again. Used probably half as much water, perhaps too little. Bread went in at 1:47PM.
Used a bit of cornmeal on the peel, perhaps a bit too little.
Still had difficulty transfering from peel to stone, but bread was not super stuck to peel.
The loafs were too close together on the peel, and touched once transfered to the baking stone.
I had to manually separate using the bench scraper.
Additionally, loafs caught in the middle before the edges, and are thus banana shaped on the peel.

Out of the oven at 2:13. I think the oven might run a bit hot, might need to vent at 15 minutes next time and reduce temp to 425 or so.
